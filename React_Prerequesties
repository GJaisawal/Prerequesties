HTML: Having a good grasp of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is essential as React involves creating user interfaces, which are primarily built using HTML elements.

CSS: Understanding CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is important for styling your React components and making them visually appealing.

JavaScript: React is a JavaScript library, so a strong understanding of JavaScript is crucial. Concepts like variables, data types, functions, arrays, objects, loops, 
conditionals, scope, and closures are fundamental.
